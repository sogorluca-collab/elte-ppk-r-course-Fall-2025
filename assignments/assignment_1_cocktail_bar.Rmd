# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r reading the data, include=FALSE}
dt <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

head(dt)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

Here is the cleaned cocktail-repertoire:

```{r task 2, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

dt_long <- dt %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>")

dt_clean <- dt_long %>%
  mutate(
    ingredient = ingredients %>%
      str_remove_all("\\d+\\s?\\d*/?\\d*\\s?oz") %>%  
      str_remove_all("\\b\\d+\\.?\\d*\\b") %>%        
      str_remove_all("\\(.*?% abv\\)") %>%  
      str_remove_all("\\b(bsp|dash|dashes|drop|drops)\\b") %>%
      str_remove_all("[[:punct:]]") %>%               
      str_replace_all("^\\s+|^\\.+", "") %>% 
      str_squish() %>%
      str_to_title() 
    
  ) %>%
  select(-ingredients)

knitr::kable(dt_clean)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r task 3, echo=FALSE}
ingredient_list <- dt_clean %>%
  distinct(ingredient) %>%    
  arrange(ingredient)

knitr::kable(ingredient_list)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

This is the list of all the ingredients needed:

```{r tak 4, include=FALSE}
num_unique_ingredients <- count(ingredient_list)

num_unique_ingredients

```

We will need `r num_unique_ingredients` different ingredients.


## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

The following are the 10 top ingredients:

```{r task 5, echo=FALSE}
top_10 <- dt_clean %>%
  count(ingredient, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10)

knitr::kable(top_10)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

The following drinks have the most ingredients, they all require 6 ingredients:

```{r task 6, echo=FALSE}
cocktail_counts <- dt_clean %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(num_ingredients = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

max_ingredients <- max(cocktail_counts$num_ingredients)

cocktails_most_ingredients <- cocktail_counts %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max_ingredients)

knitr::kable(cocktails_most_ingredients)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r task 7, echo=FALSE}
ingredient_usage <- dt_clean %>%
  group_by(ingredient) %>%
  summarise(num_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) %>%
  ungroup()

rare_ingredients <- ingredient_usage %>%
  filter(num_cocktails == 1)

num_rare_ingredients <- nrow(rare_ingredients)

```

There are `r num_rare_ingredients` ingredients that are in only one cocktail.

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r task 8, echo=FALSE}
cocktails_with_rare <- dt_clean %>%
  filter(ingredient %in% rare_ingredients$ingredient) %>%
  distinct(name, ingredient) %>%
  arrange(name)

knitr::kable(cocktails_with_rare)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r task 9, echo=FALSE}
cocktails_without_rare <- dt_clean %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(!any(ingredient %in% rare_ingredients$ingredient)) %>%
  distinct(name) %>%
  arrange(name)

knitr::kable(cocktails_without_rare)
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

```{r include=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r task 10, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

cocktail_matrix <- dt_clean %>%
  select(name, ingredient) %>%
  mutate(present = "X") %>%
  distinct() %>%
  complete(name, ingredient, fill = list(present = "")) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = ingredient,
    values_from = present
  ) %>%
  relocate(name)

knitr::kable(cocktail_matrix)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
